# Critical Features

## 1. Biochemistry System (4K)

Rationale: Core to creature behavior. It drives chemical interactions, energy, and life processes. Without it, creatures canâ€™t "live."
Includes: Biochemical rules (e.g., hunger, pain, comfort).


## 2. Stimuli & Sensory System (4K)

Rationale: Enables creatures to react to their environment. Essential for interaction with the world.
Includes: Light, heat, water, food, threat, smell detection.

## 3. Decision Matrix (4K)

Rationale: Links biochemistry to actions, forming the backbone of autonomous behavior.
Includes: Mapping chemical states to creature actions (approach, eat, sleep, etc.).

## 4. Instincts System (4K)

Rationale: Pre-wired actions allow for innate, recognizable behaviors. These are essential for making creatures feel "alive."
Includes: Instinctive responses like retreating from danger or eating when hungry.

# Medium-Priority Features (Adds Depth)

## 5. Environment Interaction (4K)
Rationale: Adds realism by allowing creatures to interact with their surroundings (e.g., consuming food, emitting chemicals, attacking, or being attacked).
Includes: Systems for terrain, water, food resources, and interaction.

## 6. Genetic Encoding (4K)
Rationale: Critical for evolution and customization. Encodes biochemistry, stimuli, decisions, and instincts into DNA.
Includes: Mutations and inheritance systems.

# Lower-Priority Features (Enhancements)

## 7. AI Behavior Learning (4K)
Rationale: Introduces flexibility and adaptation beyond instincts. Allows creatures to modify their behavior over time.
Includes: Basic neural network or reward-based learning mechanism.
